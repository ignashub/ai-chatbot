  "content": "\nTap inside the house : Wherever available, tap water is preferable for drinking \nand domestic use. The water pipe, which brings the water to the house should be \nintact (not broken), have no holes and should not be leaking. \nBore Wells: The surroundings of the well should be clean, paved with bricks to \nprevent water collection outside the well. Wells should be covered and protected \nfrom animals. People should not be allowed to wash clothes and utensils close to the well. This is because the dirty water seeps into the ground next to the well wall and contaminates the well water. Toilets should be at least 100 meters away from the well and at lower ground level. The best possible way to draw water from a well is through a hand pump. \nRainwater: Households with a rooftop rainwater harvesting system, should \nensure that the first rain is flushed off for about 15 minutes. Rooftops and gutters \nmust be cleaned just before the rainy season. ",
