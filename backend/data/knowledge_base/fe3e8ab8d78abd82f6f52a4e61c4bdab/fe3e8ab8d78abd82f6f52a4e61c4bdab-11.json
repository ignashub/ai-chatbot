Anything that we eat and drink must be broken down into \nsmaller molecules of nutrients before they can be absorbed into the blood and \ncarried to cells throughout the body. Digestion is the process by which food and \ndrink are broken down into tiny particles so that the body can use them to build, \nnourish cells and provide energy. It involves mixing food with digestive juices, moving it through the digestive tract, and breaking down large molecules of food into smaller molecules. This process begins in the mouth, when we chew and \nswallow and is completed in the small intestine. Thoroughly chewing the foods \naids the digestion process.\nOrgans that make up the digestive tract are the mouth, esophagus, stomach, \nsmall intestine, large intestine - also called the colon - rectum, and anus.
