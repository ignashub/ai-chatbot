The Reproductive System concerns itself with procreation.\nRespiratory System: Oxygen Delivery System\nOur body constantly needs blood supply to deliver oxygen and \nnutrients to different organs of the body. This is done through \nthe circulatory and respiratory systems. The heart, the lungs, and the blood vessels work together to make this happen.  The \nrespiratory (breathing) system consists of the nose, trachea, \nlungs, and diaphragm. Its primary function is to supply the blood with oxygen. When a person inhales, air enters the windpipe through the nose. The windpipe goes into the chest where it divides into two and goes into the right and left  lungs. The air breathed in contains oxygen and this passes into the blood. Carbon \ndioxide (unclean air) in the body passes into the lungs and is breathed out. ",
