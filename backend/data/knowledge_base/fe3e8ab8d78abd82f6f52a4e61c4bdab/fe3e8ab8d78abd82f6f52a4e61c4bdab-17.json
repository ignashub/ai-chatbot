They do everything from allowing us to walk to keeping our blood \nflowing! \nSome muscles are known as \u201cvoluntary\u201d -- that is, they only work when we \nspecifically tell them to. When we say something, swing a bat, or clap our hands, \nthese are voluntary movements. Others like the contracting of the heart, the movement of the diaphragm so that we can breathe, or blinking of our eyes is automatic. These muscles move through signals from the nerves, and, in some \ncases, the brain, as well. \nNervous System and the Brain\nThe nervous system controls the different organs and functions of the body.  It \nworks all the time to keep us alive. There are two major divisions of the nervous system: \n\u2731 The central nervous system \n\u2731 The peripheral nervous system \nThe central nervous system consists of the brain and the spinal cord. The brain lies within the skull and controls body functions by sending and receiving messages through the spinal cord. ",
