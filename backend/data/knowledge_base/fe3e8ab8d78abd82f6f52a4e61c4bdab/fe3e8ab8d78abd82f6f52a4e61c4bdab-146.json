This reduced flow \ncan cause -\n\u2731  Chest pain. \n\u2731 Heart failure.\n\u2731 Heart attack.\n\u2731 High blood pressure can burst or block arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the brain, causing stroke.\nIschemic  Heart Disease \n This is a disease, which affects the blood vessels supplying blood to the heart muscle.  When these blood vessels get blocked (either fully or partly), the supply \nof oxygen containing blood to parts of the heart muscle is reduced or cut off and \nresults in:\n\u2731 Pain in the chest, especially during exercise. \n\u2731 Heart attack.\n\u2731 Sudden death.\nHow do the blood vessels get blocked?\nAs a person grows older, the blood vessels become stiff and lose their elasticity. Eating fatty foods or lots of oily, fried items causes high quantities of fats in the \nblood. These fatty substances get deposited inside the blood vessels. This can \ncause a partial or complete blockage. ",
