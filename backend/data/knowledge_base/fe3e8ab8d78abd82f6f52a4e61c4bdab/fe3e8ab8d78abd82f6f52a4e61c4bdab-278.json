A framework can guide the participants through a \ntopic and stimulate interest in a subject. \nA good presentation contains:\n\u2731  Clear statements with examples of what is being explained \n\u2731  Organization of information\n\u2731  Re-capping of key points at the end of each sub-topic\n\u2731  Providing opportunity for participant involvement.\n\n139\nDemonstration\nDemonstration is an effective method widely used for teaching skills.  It is always \nlinked in some way to other instructional strategies. For example, learners are unlikely to learn effectively from demonstration alone.
