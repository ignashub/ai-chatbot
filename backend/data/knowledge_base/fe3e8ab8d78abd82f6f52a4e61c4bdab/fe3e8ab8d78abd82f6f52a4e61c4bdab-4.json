  "content": ", it is important to \nensure adequate attention is paid to the body, mind, family \nand environment. \nThe human body has a wonderful mechanism to maintain good health. If the person takes appropriate actions, he/she is less likely to fall sick. However, if \nillness does occur, proper management, including medical care where necessary, can help the body heal itself.\n8\nThe Human Body\nThere are essentially nine systems that are responsible for the \nstructure and functions in the human body. The Circulatory and \nRespiratory Systems make oxygen and nutrients available to the \nentire body. The Digestive and Excretory Systems are responsible for making the nutrients available as well as for expelling out unwanted waste from the body. The Nervous and Endocrine \nSystems are principally involved in the coordination and control of \nthe whole body. The Skeletal and the Muscular Systems support and enable the body to move. ",
