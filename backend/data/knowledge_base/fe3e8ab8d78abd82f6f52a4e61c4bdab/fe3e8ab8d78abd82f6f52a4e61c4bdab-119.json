This is typically done by giving the person a vaccine, which is a special \nkind of injection. Vaccines stimulate the body\u2019s own immune system (the system \nwhich protects the body against diseases) to protect the person against any infection or disease.\nImmunization is a proven tool for controlling and eliminating life-threatening \ninfectious diseases. The vaccination does not require any major lifestyle change.\nWhy immunization is Important\n\u2731  Certain diseases such as polio, tetanus, whooping cough, hepatitis, etc, can \nbe prevented through immunization. They increase the ability of the person \nto fight targeted diseases.  \n\u2731  For children, the benefits of immunization are seen when the vaccines are \ngiven at the proper age and in the correct doses. Some vaccines are given as \na single dose, others as a course of two or more doses at regular intervals. ",
