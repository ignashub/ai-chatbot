They \nshould be kept in a safe place out of reach of children.   \n\u2731  In cold weather, people light a small fire in the room/courtyard at night to keep warm. The fire should be put out before going to sleep.\nDrowning:   \n\u2731  Toddlers can drown in a bucket of water, so they should not be left alone near a bucket of water or in the bathroom. The bathroom door should not \nbe closed with a baby inside alone.\n\u2731  Young children going to swim should be under adult supervision. An adult \nwho knows how to swim, how to rescue a drowning person, and who will \nstay close to the swimming area, should accompany them. Swimming should \nnot be allowed in rivers or the sea during the rainy season. ",
