As these diseases can be \u201ccommunicated\u201d from a person/\nanimal to a healthy individual, they are called communicable diseases . The germs \nspread from an infected person to another, either by direct contact or indirectly \nthrough another medium. Indirect contact happens when germs from an infected individual are transmitted to a healthy person via infected materials such as \nwater, food or air. The infection can also get transmitted when one comes into \ncontact with infected inanimate objects such as toys, pencils, soiled linen, baby soothers and feeding bottles. There are other diseases, which spread via insects \nand animals such as mosquitoes, sand flies, flies, tics, cats and poultry.  \n Non-communicable  diseases, on the other hand, are not infectious or \ncommunicable. They cannot be transmitted from one person to another. ",
