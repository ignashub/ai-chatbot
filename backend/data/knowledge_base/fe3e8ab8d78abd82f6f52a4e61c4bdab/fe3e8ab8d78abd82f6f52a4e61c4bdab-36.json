The difference is only by time and type of \nexercise.\n\u2731 Exercise must be done daily in addition to other routine activities.\n\u2731 Modern life is making people sedentary. This is not good for health. We should look for opportunities for movement and exercise in our daily lives, \nfor instance, using the staircase instead of lifts.\n\u2731 It is important to remember that exercise also helps in managing stress.\nSenior citizens should also continue to make efforts to be as active as possible. \nAs people get older, they should not become sedentary and continue to do small household chores and move about as much as possible. People with problems or \njoint pains should not let their condition restrict them. If they have been sedentary, \nthey should start exercise gradually. \nThose who have never done any exercise before could start with brisk walking for \n10-15 minutes. ",
