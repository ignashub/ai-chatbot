The teeth must be \nkept clean and gums massaged. This is important as the gums support the teeth. \nHygiene of the mouth has to be maintained right from birth. \nInfants and children\n\u2731  The mouth, tongue and gums must be gently wiped at least 2-3 times a \nday, using a finger wrapped with a soft, clean, damp cloth. This will prevent \nformation of white deposit seen on the tongue and mouth of infants taking \nmilk.  \n\u2731  When the teeth begin to appear, the gums should be gently massaged using clean finger with glycerin or a little vegetable oil.  \n\u2731  Once the child is old enough, he/she should be taught to brush the teeth using a soft toothbrush with toothpaste or tooth powder after every meal \nand at night.
