Carbon \ndioxide (unclean air) in the body passes into the lungs and is breathed out.  \nA normal adult breathes about 16 times and a child, about 20 times in one \nminute.\nCirculatory System: Circle of Blood \n The circulatory system consists of the heart and the blood vessels. One of its \nmost important functions is to supply oxygen to all the cells in the body. Every cell \nin the body requires oxygen to stay alive and the circulatory system must supply \nthem with it. When we breathe in, the oxygen-rich blood is pumped through the \nheart to smaller and smaller blood vessels throughout the body. Carbon dioxide produced by the cells is absorbed back into the blood, which then returns to the \nlungs, is released out when we breathe out. \nThe human heart is pear-shaped, about the size of a fist and lies in the chest \ncavity between the lungs. It is responsible for supplying the body with oxygenated \nblood. ",
