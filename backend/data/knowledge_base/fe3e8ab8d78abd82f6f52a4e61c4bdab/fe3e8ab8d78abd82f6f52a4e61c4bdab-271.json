  "content": "nteers (CV) have a \nmission to motivate and support people to stay healthy or know how to take care \nof oneself in sickness and recognize signs and symptoms when professional care \nis needed.  This requires not only individual action but also collective actions of families, organizations and the community as a whole.\nTo motivate people towards self-care is not just telling them what to do. They need \nto be informed what is self-care, what will happen if they don\u2019t do it, what are the \nbenefits of doing it, how to do it, who they can turn to if they need help, etc. Even if people change their behaviours to practice self-care, without supporting and \nmotivating mechanisms, they can stop doing it any time. \nAs an individual, a person must take care of his/her own health, eat healthy \nfoods, exercise adequately, and properly manage stress. Collectively, families and communities must work together to keep their environment clean and green. ",
