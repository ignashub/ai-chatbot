  "content": "ng water : A container that had milk or fruit juice in it earlier must not be \nused to store water. Milk protein and fruit sugars remain in the container and \ncan cause bacterial growth when water is stored. Water can be stored in jerry \ncans, clay pots, buckets or plastic bottles. Care should be taken to ensure that \nthe container is covered properly at all times. Still water, which stands for long periods, can be a good breeding place for mosquitoes. A proper, tight cover can \nprevent mosquito breeding.\nAny container in which water is planned to be stored must first be properly cleaned \nwith dish soap and water. It must be rinsed thoroughly. If possible, after washing, \nthe container should be submerged in a solution of one teaspoon of non-scented \nliquid household chlorine bleach to every quart (or litter) of water (making sure the entire surface of the bottle comes in contact with the solution for a minimum of 15 seconds).
