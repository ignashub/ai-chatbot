  "content": "editation for mental and spiritual well-being\nMeditation is a practice that involves mind and body. It originated in ancient \ntimes as a part of religious and spiritual practice. Meditation relaxes the mind \nand therefore, can be beneficial in reducing mental stress. There are many types \nof meditation techniques andamong the most popular are Yoga meditation, mindfulness meditation and transcendental meditation \u2013to name just a few. \nYogic meditation involves ethical practices, stabilisation of body, breath control, \nwithdrawal of senses from external senses and concentration. In mindfulness \nmeditation, a common practice is to focus attention on a bodily function such as \nbreathing \u2013 inhalation and exhalation \u2013 so that other thoughts are blocked from \nentering into the mind. In transcendental meditation, one focuses on a word or \nphrase in the mind, or a sound that one hears. The result achieved, thereby, is \nsimilar as in mindfulness meditation.\n",
