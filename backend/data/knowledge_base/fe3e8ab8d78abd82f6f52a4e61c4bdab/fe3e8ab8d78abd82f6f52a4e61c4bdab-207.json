It must be ensured that both the joints are covered. \n\u2731  One person should gently lift the wood piece and the limb; the other person should firmly bandage the whole area to cover the wood piece.\n\u2731  If the skin is cut over the broken part, a clean bandage must be applied to cover that area.\n\u2731  When moving the person, the wood piece and the limb must be gently held so that there is less pain felt and the broken bone ends do not move.\n\u2731  One must go urgently to the district hospital.
