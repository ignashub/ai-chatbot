  "content": "the uterus. If there is no conception, the lining of the uterus comes off and the woman experiences \nbleeding, which is called \u201cmenstruation\u201d.\n \nThe Male Reproductive System\nIn men, there are two testes which contain sperm (the male unit of reproduction). Each testis is connected by a \ntube (vas deferens) to the penis (the male organ).  \nHow does conception occur? If a man and woman engage in \nsexual intercourse during the time when the egg is released \nonce a month, conception can occur. During intercourse, \nthe man releases millions of sperms through the seminal \nfluid into the vagina. Even If  just one tiny sperm successfully manages to enter the uterus to join with the egg, conception \nhappens and the woman becomes pregnant. \nImportance of maintaining good health\nGood health is necessary to lead a happy and socially and economically productive \nlife. It is also important to realize that people who are healthy fall sick less often. ",
