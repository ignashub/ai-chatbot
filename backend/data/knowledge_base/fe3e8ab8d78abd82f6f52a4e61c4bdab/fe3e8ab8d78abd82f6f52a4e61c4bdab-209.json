The \nblood pressure falls because of the loss of blood \nand the person becomes cold. The blanket will help to keep the person warm. \n\u2731  It is important to keep talking to the person so that she/he remains conscious.\n\u2731  The accompanying person should be able to tell the doctor exactly what happened. This helps the \ndoctor to make a quick diagnosis and manage the \npatient.\n\u2731 One must not crowd around the person.
