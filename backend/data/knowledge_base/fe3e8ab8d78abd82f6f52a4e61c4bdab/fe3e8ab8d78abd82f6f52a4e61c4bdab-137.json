It also reduces the ability of the body to fight diseases.\nThe common symptoms of HIV/AIDS are:\n\u2731 Low grade, continuous fever, which does not get better with usual treatment\n\u2731 Cough that lasts for a long time\n\u2731 Weight loss \n\u2731 Diarrhoea lasting for a long time, not getting better with usual treatment    \n\u2731 Lumps in the armpits, groin.\nIn the absence of treatment, the full picture of AIDS is seen.  The person will have \ninfections that occur because the body has lost the power to fight disease. These \ninclude TB of the lungs, skin infection, respiratory infection, etc. These infections do not get easily cured by medicines as the person does not have the immunity \nto fight the infection.\n",
