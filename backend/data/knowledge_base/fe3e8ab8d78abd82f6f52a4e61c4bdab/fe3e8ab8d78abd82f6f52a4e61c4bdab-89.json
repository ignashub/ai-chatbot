The water should come up to \na full boil. If the place of residence is one mile above sea level, water should be boiled for 3 minutes more or longer.\nSolar disinfection: Exposing water in disposable, clear plastic bottles to sunlight \non the roof of a house or any raised flat platform for 8 hours during a sunny day, or for two days during cloudy days can render germs as inactive. Water should be \nconsumed directly or transferred to a clean glass. To be effective, solar disinfection \nmust be applied to clear water.\nIf water is turbid, it can be removed by filtering through a clean cotton cloth, \nsuch as a clean handkerchief or cloth and then allowing the water to settle for at \nleast 30 minutes. The clear water can be further treated with solar disinfection or through chlorination. ",
