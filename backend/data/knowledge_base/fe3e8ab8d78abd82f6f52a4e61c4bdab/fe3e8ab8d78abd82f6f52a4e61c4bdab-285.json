Many times there will \nbe group members who love to talk non-stop.  This disrupts the effectiveness of group discussion.  Listed below are guidelines for CHW and CV to deal with such \nsituations:\n\u2731  The talkative member/group should not be asked any more questions. If the \nperson or group answers all the questions directed to the others, answer \nfrom another person should be sought specifically.  For example, one may \nturn to the opposite side and ask, \u201cDoes anyone on this side of the table have any ideas?\u201d\n\u2731  The talkative person or group should be politely told that \u201cYou have had an opportunity to express your ideas. Now, let\u2019s hear from others what they have \nto say on this point.\u201d Then the trainer should rephrase the question and invite \nother members to respond or address the question specifically to a person.\n",
