It is best to let the health worker decide this.\n   Ways to prevent jaundice\n\u2731  Most cases of jaundice are caused by hepatitis, due to consumption of infected food and water. Hence, precautions to eat clean food that is not stale \nmust be observed. Also, drinking safe (boiled or filtered) water as described \nin the sections earlier will help prevent many cases. \n\u2731  Some forms of liver disease causing jaundice due to viral infections can be prevented by immunisation. \nOne should always insist on sterilised or disposable needles/syringes that can be used and thrown if getting an injection. In case a blood transfusion is needed, one should take it only from a registered blood bank.\n",
