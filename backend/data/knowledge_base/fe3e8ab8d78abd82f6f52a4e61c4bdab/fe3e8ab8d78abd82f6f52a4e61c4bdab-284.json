This will make them feel valued and encourage further \ncontribution. If they miss some points, one can ask for clarification or invite \nadditional information from others. If the points are still missing, the trainer can fill in the gaps. Quiet members should be encouraged to talk by asking their viewpoint toward the issue in discussion.\n\u2731  If the trainer is asked a question, even if they know the answer, they should  not give it immediately.  One of the participants can ask them back, \"what do \nthey think?\"  This will motivate the audience to think for themselves. \n\u2731  If the discussion strays off the topic, the group\u2019s attention should be drawn \nby telling them they have gone astray, and then original questions/objectives \nshould be restated to make them focus on the main issues.\n",
