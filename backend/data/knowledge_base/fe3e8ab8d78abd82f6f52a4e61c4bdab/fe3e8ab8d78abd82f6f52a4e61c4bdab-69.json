  "content": "needs \nThere is another group of people who require special attention by the family \nand community. This group is mainly children/people who are not made the \nway everyone is. They may be mentally disturbed, physically differently abled or \nsuffering from chronic diseases, needing to be constantly looked after or nursed. In this case, it is the family and community who need to make changes in order to help them live healthy lives.  \nThe family has to accept that they have a member who is differently abled. It is \ntheir duty to look after the person with love and care, no matter the extra trouble and difficulty. It is also their responsibility to encourage and help them to be self-sufficient. \nToday, facilities are available for schooling and training children who have physical \ndisabilities and minor mental disturbances. The local government agency or the leader of the community can help in contacting these agencies to help these \nchildren chart their own way in the crowd.\n",
