The body position should not be changed. If possible, one must bring a health worker before moving him/her. If the victim has to be moved, it must be done carefully without bending the back or neck. \nHow to take a person with a broken back/neck to the hospital: \nThe injured person must be lifted with great care, without bending him anywhere. \nThe head and neck should not bend at all. Taking the help of a few people, the injured person should be placed carefully on a stretcher. If the neck is injured or \nbroken, one can put a tightly folded cloth or sandbag on each side of the head to \nkeep it from moving.\n104\nAccidents\n\u2731  Any accident leading to serious injury and \nbleeding has to be treated at the district hospital.
