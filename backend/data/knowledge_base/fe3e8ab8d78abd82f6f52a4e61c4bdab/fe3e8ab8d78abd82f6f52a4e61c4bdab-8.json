The blood \nalso absorbs glucose, an energy source, from the liver, which is the \nbody\u2019s glucose distribution center. These nutrients and energy are then transported to all the cells of the body, in a manner similar \nto the transport of oxygen. Blood also absorbs the waste products \nmade by cells, and transports them to the excretory organs for removal from the body. \nIn addition to nutrients and oxygen, the blood also carries around \nimportant disease-fighting cells. The organs of the immune system, such as the spleen, create many types of specialized cells that can kill foreign cells trying to invade the body. The circulatory system is responsible for \ntransporting these cells from the immune system to all other parts of the body. \nDuring this circulation, blood passes through the kidneys, which filter much of the waste from the blood.
