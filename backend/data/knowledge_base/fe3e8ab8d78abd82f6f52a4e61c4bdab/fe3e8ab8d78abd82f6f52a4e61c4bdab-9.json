Blood also passes through the small intestine and the liver. \nThe liver filters sugars from the blood, storing them for later use.\nBlood Cells\nThere are three different types of human blood and each has a different function.\n\u2731 Red Blood Cells\n Red blood cells perform the most important blood function. They are \nconstantly traveling through our body delivering oxygen and removing waste. \nIf they weren\u2019t doing this, our body would slowly die. Red blood cells contain \nhaemoglobin, which is a vehicle for transporting oxygen and carbon dioxide. \n\u2731 White Blood Cells: Battling Blood Cells\n Whenever a germ or infection enters the body, the white blood cells snap to attention and race toward the scene of the crime.
